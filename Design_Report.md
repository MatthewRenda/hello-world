Design Report
=============

Commands
---------
**Start / Stop**
I decided to combine the two commands into one function called cmdStamp. I did this with the mindset that the functionality of the two 
options are identical, therefore I can easily call the same function twice rather than building two different functions.

**describe**
I concatenate the input from the user and push it out to the log.

**Summary**
My Summarry function is built so that if there is a known args[1] then it shoots to printing out the specified data in the file based 
on the task input by the user. Then second option of my Summary function is when the program reads that there is no args[1] and prints
out the entire file.

Output
---------
For this project I chose to output my data to a "Task_Manager_Log.txt" file.

Overall the design for this program is greatly lacking and I hope to improve later on.
